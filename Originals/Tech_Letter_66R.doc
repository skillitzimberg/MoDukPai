TEACHING AN ART

TO: Instructors; Intermediates

Teaching an art form is as difficult as learning one. One of the reasons can be
the viewpoint of the student and the viewpoint of the teacher. Let's take the
example of a painter. The teacher shows the student the different colors--red,
blue, green, brown, etc. and then shows a person how to put them on the canvas.
Just a basic stroke of putting them on and then a couple of ideas on how to
create with them. Then the student can either say, "Oh, I think I could create
some more ideas," and does, or says, "Well, I know all that, now show me some
more colors or strokes." Now comes the difference in viewpoint. The teacher
wants the person to develop the strokes taught better (the student may feel he
already knows it well, and it's time for new strokes) or to develop the
combinations of strokes into a more creative aspect.

Martial arts is not just a science but an artistic expression of motion. There
are hundreds of varying ways to move and defend oneself. A teacher is trying to
get a person to first understand and do a basic motion, then create and express
with it. It is important that the student develop at their own rate, and that
rate can be either hindered or helped depending on the ability of the teacher.
The Instructor's Basic Data and Code (Policy #30) is helpful for sure! The other
is just "the eye" of the instructor to feel and see the motion and judge what
will help the student. This comes from experience of doing a lot of teaching.
The student must have some type of belief that they are being treated in a
manner of helping them achieve the best possible. If they don't feel that way,
they should come to the instructor and discuss it. The instructor always has an
eye out for the best total development.

Ninety nine percent of the time I know exactly where that student is, mentally
and physically, and teach in accordance. Sometimes a person will not "learn a
new requirement" for some time because I feel they need to work on what they
have. That reason could be based on their techniques--perhaps it is not up to
what I feel is an expression of the standard for either them or the Academy. Or
the person has not been training with any regularity and thus needs to get
themselves back into being a student.

There are other reasons. If the student has a question about it, he should come
to the instructor and find out. If you know the reason and it is
apparent--great. If you don't know the reason, then do not assume, ask. Also,
due to human error, there is that 1% that are done injustices, and these
injustices should be handled.

Proper etiquette indicates that a person doesn't go, "Hey, show me something
new." If you're working hard, then you will show yourself ready for something
new. Yet, if inside yourself you feel you have been training hard and your
techniques are good, but you are not learning anything new, then go to the instructor
and with proper manners find out...you do have a right to know.
