MOUNTAINS

TO: All Basic Students

We have a saying around Mo Duk Pai and that is: For Man to go to higher
plateaus, he must climb mountains. You can't expect to get somewhere further up
unless you're willing to do some climbing. Sometimes the climbing can leave you
short of breath and tired of body. That is expected.

What is funny is that the body and mind will respond pretty well to the
individual's insistence that it do what you want it to do. You just need to
focus ahead and forge ahead. When the focus gets a bit weak, then the path ahead
gets a bit cloudy.

Just by training in Mo Duk Pai, you have made a commitment to not just us but
yourself (Refer to Policy Letter #34 TRAINING & ETHICS), and it is important you
continue in the direction which you started. Concentration, intention, mental
strength, etc., are built upon and maintained by completing the actions a person
has set out to do. No matter what those actions are, you decide it is important
to attain their completion. The road is sometimes smooth and sometimes a bit
rough, but when it gets rough that is THE TIME not to allow yourself to go
tumbling down the hill. Easy words to say when things are rosey but harder to do
when it gets rough. DO NOT UNDER ESTIMATE YOURSELF! We don't, so why should
you?!

Climb the mountains, remove the obstacles, confront what you need to, and forge
ahead. You are able, you are capable, never allow anyone, including yourself, to
say otherwise...

The hills and mountains can present themselves in class or out, but mountains
are mountains and climbing them can be a lot of fun...it builds incredible
people.
