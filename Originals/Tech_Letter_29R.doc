** An instructor is a teacher who has the intentionthat after every class the
student is aware he is doing better, to teach with the purpose that the student
will learn the techniques and drills correctly, to teach only one thing at a
time (never expecting him to do step D when he can't do step B yet), to teach
with reality so whatever he does can be applied, and to answer all questions
truthfully and never compromise himself/herself as an instructor.
