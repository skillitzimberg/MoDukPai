PROMOTIONS

TO: Those going for rank (sash)

If you've decided you want to go for your next sash, here are the steps that need to be followed:

  1) Check and find out if you've been training consistently. The roll book will
  tell you what days, if any, you've missed. If you haven't been training much,
  the start and shoot for the next promotions.
  
  2) Are your dues current? They should be.
  
  3) You need your instructor's okay before you can test. Make sure you get it.
  
  4) You need to pay a testing fee.
  
  5) Make sure your requirements are down pat.
  
  6) You probably need to take a written test. Make sure you do way before your
  physical test. You get two chances at the written test so do it early enough
  to use them-just in case.
  
  7) Make a commitment and go for it.
  
  8) Check around and see what is expected of you at the test.
  
Good luck. I personally want everyone to make it. There are standards to be met. I know you can do it, if you want.

Love, Sifu
