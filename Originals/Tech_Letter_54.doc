THE STUDENT

TO: All Students

Simply stated a student is someone who is studying a subject he doesn't already
fully know.

So by definition a student must be willing to learn. That's foremost! Some of
the barriers to this are: Already "knows" the subject, the student is being
forced to learn it when he doesn't want to, or the person is being a spectator
with the subject to see if it works rather than trying wholeheartedly to make it
work.

If the person is willing, he must first duplicate the materials before he can
understand. In Kung Fu it's important the person has done or can do the
techniques. Thus, the understanding is much higher. At the Academy, it's
important a person studies their materials for application whether that be in
the mental, physical, or spiritual level.

It's important to be a student and it's important to be a good student. It's the
only way I know to learn anything in life. Here is a good place to practice the
art of being a student.
