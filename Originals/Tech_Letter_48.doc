MONKEY LINE

TO: Intermediates

When two or more people attack you, the most optimum would be to fight only one
at a time. Thus, the ideal would be to constantly line up your opponents in a
straight line and fight the one at the front of the line. With this idea in mind
came the Monkey Line.

A basic Monkey Line works like this: One person (the defender) is standing in a
room with 2 or more people in a straight line in front of him. Distance is
appoximately 6 feet. At a signal given by the Instructor, the first person
attacks the defender with a roundhouse punch. As soon as the first attacker
actually swings, the next person begins the attack with the same punch. The next
attacker does not wait until the person in front of him is "taken care of" but
just continues the assault until he is handled. (Handled here means-enough force
received by the opponent whichs stops him from continuing any more aggressive
actions against you.) You continue the line of people until all are down and
handled. Then you say "okay" and the group gets up. Until you say "okay," ANYONE
who moves before this command must be totally handled. Monkey Line is done at
slow speed unless otherwise indicated by the instructor.

The purpose of the Monkey Line is to familiarize a student with handling a
quantity of attackers and to line up attackers in a straight line.

There are a multiple of variations of this drill which can be used. Examples:
Two monkey lines coming at you from two different directions. Different
techniques thrown at you from the attackers. Speed of attacks varied. Intensity
of contact varies. There's as many varieties as you can imagine. So please do.
