TECHNOLOGY

TO: All Students

You hear and see the word Tech used a lot around here. By Tech we mean
Technology, which means the method of *application* of an art or science as
opposed to *mere knowledge* of the science or art itself.

This definition is used to differentiate between the "armchair quarterback" who
really has no idea of the application of something and the person who really has
the tech and can enjoy it.

The Academy is into the application. We like theories and they are fun, but the
function of something is much more important than the structure of something.
