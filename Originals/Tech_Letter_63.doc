CONTROL

TO: Instructors and Students

We are going to define control as the ability to start an action, change it and
stop it at will.

If you can do all three things-start, change, stop-at will, then you have control.

Now you can have different varieties of control-some can start a techique but
can't stop it. Others can stop it well but can barely start it. Others do a very
wild and uncontrolled change. All of these basically no control or a definite
lack of specific control.

The person who accidentally hits someone is just showing lack of control. The
guy who blows his top as the inappropriate time, or when he does not want to, is
showing no control. The person who is stepping off of curbs and falling or
tripping over their own feet is showing lack of control. I am sure you can think
of many more examples.

The idea is to get in control to do the action you want to complete-whatever
that action may be.

In Full Contact fighting, it is important you hit hard and through the
person-that shows control. But in a no-contact tournament that is considered
no-control. It is pretty definite that you need to define what you are trying to
accomplish so you can see whether you have control or not.

If control over your body means touching your toes, then great. But to a dancer,
that is a start.

One method of deciding what kind and how much control a person wants is to
follow after someone who they feel shows the type of control they wish to have.
Ballet people may watch Rudolf Nureyev or Margo Fontaine, as an example;
football people watch Joe Namath. You find someone who reflects that attitude,
whether that be physical or mental.

Take a minute and think of 3 or 4 things with which you do have good control.
Then think of three or four things you could use some work on.

One of the ideas in Mo Duk Pai is to take control over your body and over your
own life. Whatever that may mean to you, I hope we can help.
