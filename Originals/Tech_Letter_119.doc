RULES & REGULATIONS

To: All Students

The following rules are designed to aquaint new students with the operation of
this school and what is expected of each person. The instructor feels these
regulations will allow him to teach more effectively and aid each student in
absorbing more from class.

1. All members are to do the salutation before entering or leaving the training area.

2. Respet your INSTRUCTORS, FELLOW MEMBERS and YOURSELF. Respect the rights and
property of others. Respect the art you are learning.

3. No senior or advanced student is to take unnecessary advantage of any junoir
or beginner in or out of class. In other word, no unnecessary roughness,
excessive or brutal contact. we are here to learn, not to hurt.

4. If at any time the Chief Instructor appears after the class has started, the
first one to see him will call the class to attention, salute him and stay at
attention until told to continue.

5. If any Black Belt or Chief Instructor or Head Instructor from any system
appears and is recognized by any student, he or she shall call the class to
attention and say, "salute the visiting black belt before you," salute, then the
class can continue their training.

6. There are to be no street shoes worn in the training area for any reason.

7. If a student comes in late, that student will go to the "gate of the class"
and enter. Upon the instructor waving you in, go to the instructor, shake their
hand, apologize for being late, abnd ask permission to join class. If granted,
fall in for training.

special occasions.
