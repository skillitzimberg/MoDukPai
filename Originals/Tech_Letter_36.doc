SLOW SPARRING

TO: All Students

DEFINITION OF SPAR: Make motions of attack and defense with the arms, hands and legs.

The purpose of slow sparring is two-fold:

  1) to see the openings that you and your opponent may have and take advantage of them.
  2) to allow yourself to get scored on without upset or needing to speed up to block it.
  
The idea is to slowly punch, kick and block with your partner. Don't speed up to
block, just keep the same rate of speed going and see what *could* have scored
on you and what you could have scored with. *Don't* speed up to attack, just
keep the same rate of speed.

Remember: Make the blow come within 1" of your partner.

Enjoy it. Learn from it. Control your body and see what techniques you can use.
Watch your body positioning, block without speeding up, but--most of all--have
fun!
