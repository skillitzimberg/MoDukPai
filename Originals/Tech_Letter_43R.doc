CONTACT ASSIST DRILL

TO: All Students

The Contact ASsist techniques have found such wide use, not only in our school
but throughout the Northwest, and has been such a helpful technique that we use
it constantly in Mo Duk Pai.

Due to the fact that it's been interpreted in so many various ways, I quote the source of this assist so there will be no altering of this very useful information:

  * "Contact Assist. The patient is taken to the area where the injury occured
    and makes the injured member gently contact it several times. A sudden pain
    will fly off and the injury if minor, lessens or vanishes."
    
I hope this clears up any confusions. It's a practically-oriented idea that has
reduced pain and injury for many years.

Sincerely,

Frederic D. King
Founder
