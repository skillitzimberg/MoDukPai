TRAINING

TO: All Students

The Academy is here to help you. One of our jobs is to get you through any "humps" so you can become more able.

To get better you must train at least two times a week. If you can't make it per your scheduled time:
  1) Call and let reception know.
  2) Tell the day you will make it up.
  3) Come in that day and make it up.
  
A student should have a fixed schedule. It's giving order to your life and to the instructor who's teaching.

Decide what two days you are going to train and stick to them (you can come
more-most do). It's easy in life to put things off. We are here to help you get
better. We wouldn't be doing our job if we allowed you to let the things that
"come up" deter you.

Things will come up occasionally that are really difficult. OKAY! Let us know.

That's what we are about here. Making you more able to handle life. Train hard-stick to it-but the main thing is be persistent and unreasonable. You can do it. You've already started. Don't back off now-we'll help!

Love, Sifu

P.S. To be totally honest, I'm a worry wort about my students. If you don't call, I worry. Save me some worry-communicate.
