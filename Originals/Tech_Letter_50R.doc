HARMONY SPARRING

To: Intermediate Students

When you and someone are working together trying to accomplish something, you
could very easily say you are in harmony. You are working *with* the other
person, not against them or evenly *only* for yourself, but together.

The same thing could be said about harmony sparring. You and your partner are working together to accomplish three things:

  1) Allowing yourselves to get hit without wincing, upset, or needing to speed up.
  2) Trying to find those openings on the other person and then put a kick, punch, sweep, or any usable technique there.
  3) Getting into the same rhythm as the other person so you are actually
     matching speed and beats. Like music you flow, you are constant motion, never
     stopping but always punching, kicking, sweeping, etc.
     
When you are in harmony, you'll know. There will be no worries about being hit
or getting hit. You'll just be there enjoying it.

Some of the things done incorrectly are: Getting into a "who hit who" attitude,
going for points, worrying about getting hit, not finding the rhythm of your
partner, not keeping the same speed.

The original purpose of this drill was to help a person gain better confront and
coordination. There are other abilities to be gained when a person consistently
does this drill. Try it.

Have a good time with it.

Love, Sifu
