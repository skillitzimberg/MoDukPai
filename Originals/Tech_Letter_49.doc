REPETITIONS

TO: Intermediates

Repetitions, or "Reps" as they are more often known, are multipurposed. First,
they allow you to vary the many different kinds of attacks that may occur
against you and your response to those attacks. Second, you develop a creative
atmosphere of dealing with each variety of attack that you can come up against.

A basic rep is done in this manner. You and your partner face each other in a
normal stance. Your partner throws a roundhouse punch at your head. You handle
the attack by overwhelming your partner with a barrage of kicks, punches,
throws, sweeps, etc., until your opponent is down and out on the ground. Even
then you can continue the action until there is no movement in your partner. At
thast time you back off of your opponent in such a way that he cannot view you
should he "come to." Also, stay close enough to your partner so that you can
move in and handle him with ease should he move before you stop the rep.

The original purpose of this drill was to terminatively handle a very life
endangering problem-someone who is bent on your destruction. The actual
execution of a "Full Rep" is only done when there is no other alternative but to
"put the guy away." It's dangerous and important.

Some of the things done incorrectly on reps is: Not to continue to hit even
though the person is moving. Not to move to a safe position where the person
cannot see you. Not being creative when training it. Not saying "okay" to the
person so they know you are finished.
