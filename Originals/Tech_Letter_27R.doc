REQUIREMENTS/TEACHING

TO: All Orange Sashes and Above

Going toward Black Belt is a path in which a person must understand what he is
doing, not robotically but fully. To help those achieve comprehensibility of The
Art, there are two steps:
  1) Duplicating, and
  2) Understanding
  
In regard to understanding something, after you have duplicated it, it helps to
show someone else and coach them on it. It improves your own certainty.

To help those gain certainly, it will now be part of sash requirements to help
teach in a class situtation under the watchful eye of a qualified instructor of
that level. This doesn't mean you have to run an entire class. It means you need
to help coach others within a class situation and get you to really GETY the
information you have learned.

This does two things:
  a) gets one to totally understand, and
  b) helps other students get better.
  
Requirements should not be taught out of class unless specifically okayed by a
Black Belt instructor. It's time that proper teaching is done on both a physical
and mental level, and the best way to assure this is for you to duplicate and
understand the materials you are learning.

Time Requirements are:
  Orange = none
  Purple = 6 hours
  Blue = 8 hours
  Green = 10 hours
  Brown = 18 hours
  Brown/Black = 36 hours
  Black = 45 hours
