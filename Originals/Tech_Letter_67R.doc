SIX PRIMARY TARGETS OF THE HUMAN BODY

TO: Intermediates

Actually there are hundreds and possibly thousands of targets on the human body.
Of course, many are lethal and others are not. I could name off the nerves,
nerve centers, joints, etc. that one could classify as good target areas, but I
won't. What I will name off are six of the primary ones that are easily gotten
to with the least amount of trouble.

If you view these targets and can connect at will, you're pretty safe to handle the situation.

These are not given in preference, just numbered. When and how you attack these
primaries will be determined by the situation that is occuring and the damage
you wish to inflict.

  1) Eyes
  2) Groin
  3) Knee/shin
  4) Temple
  5) Throat
  6) Ears
  
There are a multitude of others, but this is a pretty good start.
