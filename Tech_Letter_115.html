WHAT ARE WE DOING?

TO: All Students

It is a very funny thing that I have just realized. I keep hearing from
countless people (nearly daily) on how great this school is, how the
people---both staff and students--really care. How hard everyone works and,
better yet, how people are getting so much better in life. Oh, my gosh, I
thought--we are doing something right. It is very important to not only know
what you are doing but to continue doing it. So I looked around and came up with
some interesting answer.

The surveys we have done came up with a couple of things that might be of
interest to you. First of all, people are really getting in better shape
physically. "More flexible, better coordination, losing weight, etc." Now, that
is good to hear. The second thing which was very interesting now, I have known
this for years, but to see it verified by survey was gratifying) was that people
were mentally feeling A LOT BETTER. Not just a little but a lot. "Increased
awareness, more self confidence, able to dael with problems better,
communicating better, off drugs..." were some of the comments heard over and
over. Now that is something you don't get at your nearby racquetball club.

What the school does do is help those help themselves. When you discipline
yourself, learn the power of concentration, push through barriers, and
accomplish goals, those are all factors that a person can use in every day life.
When people can actually see others helping each other become, it becomes more
real that in general could be that way.

It is gratifying to know we are accomplishing what we set out to do. What are we
doing? We are helping! We are helping those who can do well already do even
better. It takes a lot of guts to train here and want to better oneself
physically and mentally. People are doing better than they ever thought or
imagined. It is working. Great.

We will continue in that direction. It is what we set out to do, and it seems to
be working out very well.

Love, Sifu
